The back end rest API has five different api routes. The main api route contains the full json object. The other routes are parameterized. The routes filter by instructor, by the course code, by the course level, and a dual query of both the instructor and the level.

To use the application, go to the main home page https://course-query-project.herokuapp.com/home and search for courses. Then press the submit button to find what courses the query returns. These queries use the json object that was filtered by the back end api and displays these results.
